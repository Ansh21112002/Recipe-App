# Recipe-App
Food is essential for good physical and mental health. It is more than just an essential element of life for some, for others, it is a major factor that can change a bad mood into a frivolous one. After a long day of work, or a busy schedule, people want to come home for a meal and rest. Of course serving food is easy and fun but home-cooked food has its own taste and satisfaction. Finding the right source for learning how to cook for a beginner is difficult. That's why we came up with the idea of ​​a recipe that gives users step-by-step recipes to make food preparation work less hectic.

The app is full API based and is ran on API namely Spoonacular API which is retrofit API .
To use a retrofit API in android studio we have to import library. We can do it by writing the following line in build Gradle:
“implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0'.”
 
This is the library which can manage request response of API
One more library is used which is imported by following line of code:
“implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.9.0'”
Another library is used which is used to load API images .
Picasso Library: implementation 'com.squareup.picasso:picasso:2.71828'.
